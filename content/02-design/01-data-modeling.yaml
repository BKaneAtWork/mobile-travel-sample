title: Data Modeling
description: |
  Progressive disclosure of the data model in the travel sample bucket and the guest bucket. The Travel Sample bucket is synchronized between the mobile clients and the Couchbase Server. The guest bucket is a local-only database that is embedded in the mobile client.
  
  In this lesson you will learn how to model the data for an application and the relationships between the different models.
  
  Couchbase stores data in documents rather than in table rows. A document is a JSON object containing a number of key-value pairs that are typically correlated. This means that it can take any form as long as it is valid JSON. The following represents the same schema as the table above but in JSON format.
  
  TODO: Show document as JSON for each entity.

  - title: Document Types
    description: |
      Unlike tables, in Couchbase, all the documents are stored in the same namespace. So you typically use an additional property to differentiate between each entity. Let’s call it type.

  - title: Document IDs
    description: |
      Every document in Couchbase is associated with a unique key that must be provided by the user when the document is created. The key is the unique identifier of the document and can take any format. However, it is recommended that you give it a value that provides some context about the contents of the document.
      For instance, in the travel app data set, the document Key/ID is of the format `{doc.type}_{alphanumeric_string}`. Here `{doc.type}` provides some context of the purpose of the document and in combination with the `{alphanumeric_string}`, it uniquely identifies the string.
      The document Key will be listed as “ID” on Couchbase Server admin console. The key is also referred to as the Document ID.

    tryitout:
      - Option 1, Log into the CB server , search for document with specific key “airline_137” and write down some property value of “icao” in the text box below.
      - Option 2, Show couple of examples of travel sample doc and ask them to give it a key using format specified above.
