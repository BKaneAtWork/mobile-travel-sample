:page-aliases: tutorials:travel-sample:develop/java,tutorials:travel-sample:develop/java/index

== Pre-requisites
While you can use any IDE of your choice suited for Java development, in this tutorial we will be working with *IntelliJ IDEA*. All instructions in the workshop assume this IDE.

* IntelliJ IDEA 2019 or above downloadable from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac[Jetbrains Developer site]. The *Community* version is sufficient for our purposes.
* JDK 8

*Windows Users* : If you are developing on Windows, you must use a Windows 10 machine.
Also, note that if you choose the Manual or Docker installation mode, you should also have *administrative privileges on the Windows box* so you can authorize the installation and running of the required executables.

== Travel Sample Mobile App

* Clone the "master" branch of the Travel Sample app from GitHub. We are doing a shallow pull with `depth` as 1 to speed the cloning process. 
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone -b master --depth 1 https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample.git
----
* Open *java/TravelSample/build.gradle* using IntelliJ IDEA.
* Build and run the project (preferrably in Debug mode)
