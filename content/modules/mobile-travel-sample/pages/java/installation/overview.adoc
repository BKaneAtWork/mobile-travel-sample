== Components

This is the high level architecture of the system that we will be running image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/travelsampleapp-arch.png[]

It includes the following components:

* Client Side
** Travel Mobile App
** An iOS App in Swift that is linked with Couchbase Lite Enterprise 2.1
* Server Side
** Couchbase Server Enterprise v5.5
** Sync Gateway Enterprise v2.1
** Travel Web App
** Python web app integrated with Couchbase Python SDK

*For the server side components, you have
    three installation options*

NOTE: Make sure you use the same installation option for _all_ server components (i.e. if you selected Docker (Local), then you must use docker for all of them and so on.)

* **Manual**: Here, you would download and install the components on your local machine. 
* **Docker (Local)**: In this case, you would install all the server components in separate docker containers on your local machine. 
* **Cloud (Rightscale)**: In this case, you can launch and connect to an instance of the server components running on a cloud instance.

== Pre-requisites

To start, it is easiest if you run all the components on the same machine.
It's not required to run your development environment this way but it is more convenient to start a development environment with components running locally. 

*Windows Users* : If you are developing on Windows, we recommend that you use a Windows 10 machine.
Also, note that if you choose the Manual or Docker installation mode, you should also have *administrative privileges on the Windows box* so you can authorize the installation and running of the required executables.

=== Android

* Android Studio 2.3.3 or above https://developer.android.com[Google Developer site]
* Android device or emulator running API level 19 or above 
* Android SDK 26 
* Android Build Tools 26 
* JDK 8 

=== Visual C++ 2017 (Only Windows Users)

You need this only if you use the "Manual" installation option. *Windows users* must install the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python Downloadable from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266[here].

=== Python (v2.7 and above)

You need this only if you use the "Manual" installation option - Downloadable from https://www.python.org/downloads/[python.org]

*Windows Users* : If you are developing on Windows, make sure that Python is included in your system's PATH environment variable.
You can follow instructions https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/[here] to set your PATH variable. 

=== Docker

You need this only if you use the "Docker" installation option.

*Windows Users* : If you are developing on Windows, you may need to install Docker as Admin user downloadable from https://www.docker.com/get-docker[docker.com].
The Community Edition would suffice.

=== git

* Create a https://github.com[free github account] if you don't already have one.
* Git can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git-scm.org].

=== Try it out

* Open Android Studio 
* Verify the python installation (applicable only if you decided to use the Manual install option).
** Run the following command from your terminal.
+
[source,bash]
----
bash python --version
----
You should see the version of python displayed.
* Verify the docker installation (applicable only if you decided to use the Docker install option).
** Run the following command from your terminal.
+
[source,bash]
----
bash docker -v
----
You should see the version of docker displayed.
* Verify git installation 
** Run the following command from your terminal.
+
[source,bash]
----
bash git --version
----
You should see the version of git installed.
