= Overview

== Components

This is the high level architecture of the system that we will be running image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/travelsampleapp-arch.png[]

It includes the following components - - Client Side - Travel Mobile App - An iOS App in swift that is linked with Couchbase Lite Enterprise 2.1 - Server Side - Couchbase Server Enterprise v5.5 - Sync Gateway Enterprise v2.1 - Travel Web App - Python web app integrated with Couchbase Python SDK 

*For the server side components, you have
    three installation options*

*NOTE* : Make sure you use the same installation option for _all_ server components.
i.e.
if you selected Docker (Local), then you must use docker for all of them and so on. 

* **Manual**: Here, you would download and install the components on your local machine. 
* **Docker (Local)**: In this case, you would install all the server components in separate docker containers on your local machine. 
* **Cloud (Rightscale)**: In this case, you can launch and connect to an instance of the server components running on a cloud instance.

== Pre-requisites

To start, it is easiest if you run all the components on the same machine.
It's not required to run your development environment this way but it is more convenient to start a development environment with components running locally.
